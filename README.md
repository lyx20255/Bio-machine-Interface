# Bio-machine Interface for Machine Learning-Enabled Multimodal Monitoring on Wound based on Pro-healing Acellular Dermal Matrix

## release training code

Fully biocompatible bio-machine interface (BMI) addresses key challenges in biocompatibility, functional integration, and energy efficiency of bioelectronics by synergizing multimodal sensing with therapeutic interventions. We develop a pro-healing acellular dermal matrix-based BMI that monitors glucose, temperature, pH and moisture using a single ultra-low power device (â‰¤ 5 pW) under one electrical stimulus, replacing complex multi-sensor arrays. Integrated cloud-based machine learning and feature fusion techniques precisely decode biomarker data, enabling real-time analysis of wound microenvironment dynamics. Therapeutically, this system accelerates healing through enhancing dermal remodeling, stimulating neovascularization, and increasing collagen deposition, while exhibiting specific strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. These effects are molecularly validated by upregulated expression of wound healing-associated genes and pathways, and microbiome analysis. The seamless integration between organism and electronic systems establishes a paradigm for personalized wound management and investigating dynamic interaction between biological tissues and bioelectronic systems, directly advancing the medical technologies driven by artificial intelligence.
